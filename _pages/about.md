Hi there !

I am Thimo, a student of theoretical physics at [Durham](https://www.ippp.dur.ac.uk/) and [Heidelberg](https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/) University. With my background in physics, I am 
very interested in complex, emergent phenomena regarding different (energy) scales of systems in the context of non-equilibirum Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Having written my B.Sc. thesis about the formation of
structures in Cosmology, I am passionate about phenomena on the biggest and smallest scales, and, in particular, how the scaling of these phenomena is correlated with their respective degrees of freedom. The emergence of effective theories due to a reduction in complexity and degrees of freedom has lead us to many successful effective descriptions of our physical reality, like hydrodynamics, classical mechanics, thermodynamics and quantum mechanics. The general mechanism underlying the reduction of sensitivity on the degrees of freedom at the most fundamental level has to be investigated further. Such a reduction is only natural, as we are otherwise faced with providing an infinite amount of correlation functions for the system at hand, which makes an effective description unfeasible. Tracing this loss of sensitivity, one can investigate the emergence of entropy, the emergence of an arrow of time, the thermalization process and the overall scaling of informational properties. This will in particular provide us with a more thorough understanding about the foundations of quantum theory and its applications in solid-state physics and quantum computing.  
Currently, I am working on my M.Sc. thesis at Durham University on particle theory on the intersection of nonequilibrium and perturbative vacuum descriptions of QFT. In particular, I am trying to understand the phenomenon of [Higgsplosion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04365.pdf), proposed by my supervisors M. Spannowsky and V. Khoze, in the context of an effective kinetic theory in nonequilibrium QFT.

Aside from my passion for physics, I have gotten more and more interested in contributing to the field of [AI safety research](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HBxe6wdjxK239zajf/what-failure-looks-like).
Having been involved in the [effective altruism movement](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/), I quickly came to the realization that the advent of general artificial intelligence (AGI) will be one of the major tipping points of this centry, the steep progress of climate change being another. Therefore, I am very interested in contributing to making AI architectures robust, sustainable and aligned with human values, especially to the question of discrimination present in our society. Additionally, I am also actively trying to contribute to tackling [climate change](https://www.climatechange.ai/) by employing my physics background and machine learning techniques.
These two (interconnected) fields are the ones I want to contribute to more in the future due to their immediate relevance today.
