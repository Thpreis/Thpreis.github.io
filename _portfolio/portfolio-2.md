This is a compendium about my understanding of [Quantum Field Theory](http://thpreis.github.io/files/QFTnotes.pdf). It comprises a collection of different QFT lectures I attended, corresponding Mathematics lectures and subsequent lectures in Conformal Field Theory, String Theory and my understanding of other more specific topics related to the subject.
