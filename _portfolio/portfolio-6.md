title: "M.Sc. Thesis: A strong-field kinetic perspective on particle
production and Higgsplosion from nonequilibrium QFT"
excerpt: "In an effort to compare the nonequilibrium 2PI real-time Schwinger-Keldysh formalism
and the asymptotic state construction of vacuum theory, we explore particle production
including a strong field in a nonequilibrium kinetic setting. Employing a loop expan-
sion to leading order, we derive a scalar strong-field kinetic system which is complete to
leading order O(λ) in a strong-field coupling counting. Together with the 2PI equations
of motion for statistical and spectral dynamics under the kinetic limit, a kinetic equation
and a background field equation for the collisional strong-field regime is derived. With
this self-consistent kinetic system for strong-field dynamics at our disposal, we identify
different mechanisms for particle production in kinetic theory. Collisionless particle
production arises from a O(λ^0) drift term, where in particular production of gap-less
modes becomes possible in the presence of a tachyonic instability. Collisional particle
production proceeds through O(λ) inelastic scattering processes. These mechanisms for
particle production are driven by fluctuations of the strong background field, where the
latter is sub-leading to the former in the strong-field coupling and facilitates particle
production in the language of scattering amplitudes and decay rates. Such a description
facilitates a comparison to particle production processes in vacuum theory, which we
explore on the example of the Higgsplosion mechanism. By virtue of formulating ex-
plicit collision terms, we are able to isolate a local dynamical scattering amplitude and
a corresponding dynamical decay rate, both are directly dependent on the fluctuations
of the strong background field. A translation to scattering expressions of vacuum the-
ory is achieved to remarkable agreement by artificially setting the energy contribution
of the background field to zero in order to bridge the otherwise necessary dynamical
process of thermalization. By comparison we demonstrate how our strong-field kinetic
description generalizes a standard kinetic description of near-equilibrium Bose-Einstein
condensation by coupling statistical to off-shell strong-field dynamics."

This my [M.Sc. Thesis](http://thpreis.github.io/files/msc-thesis_ThimoPreis_Digital.pdf) concerned with the development of a strong-field kinetic framework from the first principles of nonequilibrium QFT. After deriving a closed set of equations in spectral, statistical and strong-field dynamics to leading order in a strong-field coupling, this work makes an effort to investigate mechanisms of strong-field particle production from initialization all the way to thermalization. A focus on the phenomenon of Higgsplosion developed by my supervisors M. Spannowsky and V. Khoze is kept throughout, where this work can however be read separately from this particular application.
