[Quantum Field Theory](http://thpreis.github.io/files/QFTnotes.pdf) is a compendium about my understanding of Quantum Field Theory. It is a collection of 6 different QFT lectures I attended, corresponding Mathematics lectures and subsequent lectures in Conformal Field Theory, String Theory and my understanding of other advanced topics related to the subject.
