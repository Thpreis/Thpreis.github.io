[General Relativity](http://thpreis.github.io/files/GRnotes.pdf) is a compendium about my understanding of General Relativity. It is a compilation of lectures on General Relativity, Cosmology and Theoretical Astrophysics (by Prof. Bartelmann) which I attended at Heidelberg University, accompanied with further insights sourced from a variety of books and lecture notes.
