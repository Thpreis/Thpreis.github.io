excerpt: 'Building upon the framework of Kinetic Field Theory developed by Bartelmann et al.,
we calculate the cosmic two-point density-fluctuation power spectrum to first order in
perturbations for particles moving along Zel’dovich trajectories. The validity of our treat-
ment is assessed by comparing our results to those obtained from standard perturbation
theory in an analytically and numerically feasible manner. We are able to accurately
reproduce the density-fluctuation power spectrum in the linear regime of cosmic struc-
ture formation as recovered in conventional approaches. The overall behaviour found
for the non-linear density-fluctuation power spectrum qualitatively agrees with results
obtained in numerical N-body simulations.'

[BSc Thesis](http://thpreis.github.io/files/Bsc_Thesis_ThimoPreis_digital.pdf) 
This my B.Sc. thesis outlining the research I conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Bartelmann](http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/research/bartelmann/) at Heidelberg University
from 04.2018-12.2018. The subject of this thesis is the formation of structures in Cosmology. Deploying a novel framework for structure
formation developed by Bartelmann et al., [Kinetic Field Theory](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AnP...53100446B/abstract), we calculate the two-point density-fluctuation power spectrum to linear order in perturbations.
This object gives us an insight about the amount of structures we find in the Universe over different length scales. The findings of this thesis
is that observations are reproduced very well by the framework of KFT already to first order in perturbation but on large scales, where the explicit
approximation scheme employed breaks down due to gravitational interactions which are neglected by the free streaming of particles.
