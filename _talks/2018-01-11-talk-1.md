This talk was presented in the context of a seminar series on Quantum Mechanics given by Prof. Sandra Klevansky and Prof. Joerg Jaeckel.
[My talk](http://thpreis.github.io/files/QMTalk201718.pdf) was on the topic of Relativistic Quantum Mechanics and why the transition to Quantum Field Theory is necessary and natural.
