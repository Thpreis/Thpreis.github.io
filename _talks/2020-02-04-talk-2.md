[This is a talk](http://thpreis.github.io/files/IntroAI.pptx) I gave as an overview of the field and potential pitfalls of AI, which was given in the context of the [Effective Altruism Durham](https://eahub.org/group/effective-altruism-durham/) local group. My intention with presenting this talk was to explore the risks posed by employing AI, the advent of AGI in the context of the alignment problem and current advances. Note, however, that I myself am not an expert on this topic.
